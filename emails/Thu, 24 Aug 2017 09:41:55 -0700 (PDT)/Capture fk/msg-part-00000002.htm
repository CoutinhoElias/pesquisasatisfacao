<div dir="ltr"><div>Good afternoon people.</div><div>.</div><div>.</div><div>I have two models: Person and Address</div><div>Address has a Person fk</div><div>I would like to register the addresses of people without the need to manually point to which person&#39;s given address will belong.</div><div>.</div><div>.</div><div>I was directed to use inlines but I hate the admin of django because if I use only the admin I will get fond and I will never have the courage to make out of the admin.</div><div>.</div><div>.</div><div>I&#39;m also no fan of the solutions they use out there like inlines.</div><div>I do not think they look good for users.</div><div>So I thought the following:</div><div><br></div><div>I fill in the data of the people form and when doing the submit and the django record I enter in the url of editing the person, there I will use another html displaying the data that I recorded and a table with the addresses that the person could have.</div><div>Next to this table I would put a button that would call the address register url where the person&#39;s fk would be invisible to the user, ie I would pass the id person to be used in the address book.</div><div>.</div><div>.</div><div>And finally after recording the address I would go back to the person editing form and that address would be displayed on the table along with the person&#39;s data.</div><div>You see?</div><div><br></div><div>Can someone help me?</div></div>
