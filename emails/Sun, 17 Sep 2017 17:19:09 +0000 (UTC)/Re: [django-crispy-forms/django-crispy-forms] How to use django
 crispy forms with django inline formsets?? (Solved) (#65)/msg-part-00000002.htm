<p>Had been struggling with the same issue after adopting crispy forms and found an insanely easy fix:</p>

           {% crispy form %}
<pre><code>       {{ formset.management_form|crispy }}
       {% for form in formset %}
            &lt;div class="form-inline"&gt;
                     {% crispy form %}
            &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's it.  I set the helper attributes and layout at the form level.  Did get rid of self.helper.form_class in the attributes.  Did not set any individual field attributes to inline.  Setting the div class around the form did the trick.</p>
